# Functional Rules - Chariot Project

This document centralizes all functional rules for the Chariot project.  
Each rule has a unique identifier and must be tested.

## FR-001: Logging System Standardization

**Rule**: Use Winston logger exclusively with NestJS injection and explicit context.

**Requirements**:
- Injection via `private readonly logger = new Logger(ClassName.name)`
- Appropriate levels: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` (with stack trace)
- Log critical events: auth, startup, errors

**Prohibitions**:
- Use `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.debug`
- Log passwords, complete tokens, or sensitive data

## FR-002: Character Universal Fields

**Rule**: All character types (Player, NPC, etc.) must include shared narrative and economic fields at the base `Character` level.

**Requirements**:
- `appearance`: age, height, weight, eyes, skin, hair, description
- `background`: personalityTraits, ideals, bonds, flaws, alliesAndOrgs, backstory
- `treasure`: cp, sp, ep, gp, pp, notes
- Exposed in Swagger on all endpoints that accept `Character` derivatives

**Prohibitions**:
- Duplicating these fields in discriminators (e.g., `Player`, `NPC`) when they already exist on `Character`

**Tests**:
- DTO validation accepts these nested structures on `CreateCharacterDto`
- Invalid types in nested DTOs are rejected

## FR-003: D&D Conditions Management

**Rule**: All characters must support D&D 5e standard conditions tracking. Player characters additionally support exhaustion levels.

**Requirements**:

**Standard Conditions** (boolean) - Available for ALL characters (Player & NPC):
- `blinded`: Character is blinded
- `charmed`: Character is charmed
- `deafened`: Character is deafened
- `frightened`: Character is frightened
- `grappled`: Character is grappled
- `incapacitated`: Character is incapacitated
- `invisible`: Character is invisible
- `paralyzed`: Character is paralyzed
- `petrified`: Character is petrified
- `poisoned`: Character is poisoned
- `prone`: Character is prone
- `restrained`: Character is restrained
- `stunned`: Character is stunned
- `unconscious`: Character is unconscious

**Exhaustion** (Player-specific only):
- Type: `exhaustionLevel` (integer, 0-6)
- Only available on Player characters, NOT on NPCs
- Level 0: No exhaustion (default)
- Level 1: Disadvantage on ability checks
- Level 2: Speed halved
- Level 3: Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
- Level 4: Hit point maximum halved
- Level 5: Speed reduced to 0
- Level 6: Death

**Validation Rules**:
- All standard conditions default to `false`
- Standard conditions are available on both Player and NPC
- `exhaustionLevel` is ONLY available on Player schema
- `exhaustionLevel` must be an integer between 0 and 6 (inclusive)
- `exhaustionLevel` defaults to 0 for Players
- Invalid exhaustion levels must be rejected

**Prohibitions**:
- Setting exhaustion level on NPCs
- Setting exhaustion level outside 0-6 range
- Using non-boolean values for standard conditions

**Tests**:
- DTO validation accepts valid conditions structure for all characters
- Player DTO accepts exhaustionLevel
- NPC DTO does NOT accept exhaustionLevel
- Invalid exhaustion levels are rejected for Players
- Conditions can be created, updated, and retrieved
- Default values are correctly applied

## FR-004: Sidebar Navigation and Redux State Management

**Rule**: The web/client application must provide a contextual sidebar navigation with centralized Redux state management. The sidebar adapts its content based on user context (Player vs Game Master), which is controlled by a global state toggle, not URL patterns.

**Requirements**:

**Sidebar Structure**:
- Fixed sidebar on the left with 280px width
- Collapsible/expandable functionality stored in Redux
- User profile section at the bottom
- Context-specific navigation items that change based on current mode
- Responsive design with overlay mode on mobile
- Navigation items reference Figma design specifications

**Redux Architecture**:
- Redux Toolkit with TypeScript for complete type safety
- Three state slices:
  - `uiSlice`: UI state (sidebar collapsed state, theme preferences)
  - `userSlice`: User profile, roles, and **current context mode** (player/GM toggled via navbar button)
  - `navigationSlice`: Current route, breadcrumbs, navigation history
- Typed hooks: `useAppDispatch`, `useAppSelector` for type-safe state access
- Redux DevTools enabled in development mode only
- Memoized selectors using `createSelector` for performance

**Context Mode Management**:
- Context is **NOT** determined by URL patterns or prefixes
- Context mode (Player/GM) is stored in `userSlice.contextMode`
- Context switch triggered by a navbar button that dispatches Redux action
- Each route in the application is inherently either Player-accessible or GM-accessible (but without URL indication)
- Keycloak roles must validate context authorization before allowing mode switch
- Context mode persists across route changes until explicitly toggled

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Keyboard navigation support: Tab for focus navigation, Escape to close sidebar
- ARIA attributes: `role="navigation"`, `aria-label="Main navigation"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-current="page"`
- Focus trap when sidebar is open in overlay mode (mobile viewport)
- WCAG AA contrast compliance (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Screen reader announcements for context mode changes
- Visible focus indicators for all interactive elements

**SSR and Next.js Compatibility**:
- All Redux-connected components must use `'use client'` directive
- Store initialization compatible with Next.js App Router SSR
- No hydration mismatches between server and client Redux state
- Redux Provider wrapped in client component before injection in layout

**Navigation Structure** (examples based on context mode):
- Player mode: Campaigns list, Campaign groups, Battle selection, Character sheets
- GM mode: Campaign management, NPC management, Encounter builder, World settings
- Shared: User profile, Settings, Logout

**Prohibitions**:
- Using global variables or React Context for navigation state (Redux is mandatory)
- Hardcoding user roles or context mode without Keycloak validation
- Detecting context from URL patterns or prefixes
- Missing accessibility attributes on interactive elements
- Client-side only routing without proper SSR handling
- Using `console.log` in production code (respect FR-001)

**Tests**:
- Redux slices unit tests (actions, reducers, selectors with all edge cases)
- Context mode toggle action and state updates
- Sidebar component rendering in both Player and GM contexts
- Keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance
- Focus trap functionality in mobile overlay mode
- SSR hydration without Redux state mismatches

## FR-005: Player Characters Without Group

**Rule**: Player characters can be created and exist without being assigned to any group. A paginated route must be available to retrieve all player characters that are not currently assigned to any group and that were created by the authenticated user.

**Requirements**:
- Player characters can have an empty `groups` array (`[]`)
- `groups` field is optional (not required) for all character types
- A dedicated endpoint `GET /characters/players/without-group` must return paginated results of player characters with empty `groups` array created by the authenticated user
- Only player characters created by the requesting user (`createdBy` matches user's `keycloakId`) are returned
- Only player characters are returned (NPCs are excluded)
- Standard authentication and authorization rules apply
- Deleted characters (`deletedAt !== null`) are excluded from results
- Supports pagination with query parameters `page` and `offset` (defaults: page=1, offset=10)
- Returns `IPaginatedResponse` with `pagination` metadata (page, offset, totalItems)

**Validation Rules**:
- Creating a player character with `groups: []` is valid
- Creating a player character without specifying `groups` defaults to `[]`
- The route must filter by discriminator `kind: 'player'`, `groups: []`, and `createdBy: userId`
- Page parameter must be >= 1
- Offset parameter must be between 1 and 100

**Prohibitions**:
- Including NPC characters in the without-group endpoint
- Returning soft-deleted characters (`deletedAt !== null`)
- Returning characters created by other users
- Allowing group assignment validation to fail when `groups` is empty

**Tests**:
- Player can be created with empty groups array
- Player can be created without specifying groups (defaults to empty)
- Route returns paginated players with empty groups created by the authenticated user
- Route excludes players created by other users
- Route excludes NPCs
- Route excludes deleted players
- Default pagination values are applied when not provided
- Correct skip/limit calculation for different pages
- Service method correctly queries MongoDB for players without groups filtered by createdBy
